	Mode 31 Switch confirmed
	ATT data looks good (timing matches up well)
	
2019-09-09 14-37-32.log
	Mode 32 Switch
	By,Bx data is clear but bad response data
	Maybe because the flight mode was not switched properly?

	Mode 32 Switch
	Bx, By looks good. Again the ATT response looks delayed

2019-09-05 16-04-06.log
	Not too much spacing between By data frequency changes but looks clear
	Mode 31 switched
	Time sync between ATT and By not defined as clearly
	
2019-09-05 15-51-25.log
	Mode 31 switch
	By is clear
	ATT data may not be as clear

2019-09-05 14-14-16.log
	Loiter Mode
	ATT data is clear
	By data is clear
	Note that PSC data is available and clear
	Probably best data set for Loiter

	Loiter Switch
	By Clear
	ATT is clear

	1 rad/s (FFT shows ~0.15 Hz)
	Out of phase
	Att is jittery

Estimation data:

00000010.log
	0.1 rad/s
	FFT shows ~0.02 Hz
	In phase, keeps up well
	1 m/s and 9 m

00000011.log
	0.25 rad/s
	(~0.043 Hz on fft)
	In phase
	0.5 m/s, 2 m

00000012.log
	1 rad/s
	0.16 hz in the fft
	In phase
	1 m/s, 1 m
	Not in phase, overshoots?
	jitters at direction changes

00000013.log
	2 rad/s
	in phase
	0.3207 Hz on fft
	4 m/s, 2 m
	Roll is out of phase, does small translation
	not in phase
	
00000015.log
	5 rad/s
	FFT shows 0.79 Hz
	no translation, just rolling side to side
	roll is laggy
	5 m/s, 1 m

00000016.log
	Hover 2
	Serves as a control for both validation and estimation

00000018.log
	Step input training log
	5 meters, 10 second hold

00000066.log
	Hover 1
	Loiter Switch
	Static Target
	Looks like a step
